Welcome to the updated version of the 'JetsApp'! ✈️ This enhanced Java application brings a more streamlined and user-friendly experience to managing your fleet of jets. Take control of your airfield with ease by performing operations such as listing the jets, flying them, and accessing information about the fastest jet and the jet with the longest range. Additionally, you can load cargo for cargo jets, engage in exciting dogfights, and add or remove jets from your fleet. We have made several improvements to enhance your interaction with the application. The menu structure has been optimized and the menu prompts are now clearer. Input validation has been implemented to handle invalid user input gracefully. These enhancements make the 'JetsApp' code more readable, robust, and user-friendly.
